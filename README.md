Bunnies Data Analysis
Project Overview:

This project evaluates the impact of the drug HEBP on bone healing in rabbits. The analysis uses SAS to explore how treatment effectiveness varies over different healing periods.

Key Steps:
**Data Preparation: **Loaded and categorized experimental data.

**Data Preparation**: Loaded and categorized experimental data.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - **Two-way ANOVA**: Examined time and drug treatment interaction effects.
  - **Proportion of Variation**: Assessed contribution of each factor.
  - **Regression Analysis**: Tested drug effectiveness on specific days.
  - **Non-parametric Tests**: Confirmed differences between treatment groups.

## Results Summary

- Significant effects of time and drug on force measurements.
- Significance difference in response variable on day 9 and 12.
- Interaction between time and drug is not significant.
- Increased force measurements over time.
- Higher force for placebo compared to HEBP.
- HEBP caused the worsening of bone healing in rabbits.
